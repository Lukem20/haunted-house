# threejs-sandbox
A place to learn and test out threejs concepts and features.
This project was my first serious step towards learning three.js. The resource I used was discoverthreejs.com/book/

To see this project, run:
npm install
npm run dev
then open localhost to witness some birds flapping, a train chugging, and some spheres turning.
